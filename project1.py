# Present a menu to users that says the following:
# Enter "about" to learn more about me
# Enter "q&a" to ask me a question
# Enter "guestbook" to get added to my guestbook
# Enter "random" for something random
# Enter "goodbye" to say goodbye!

print("")

# Each of those inputs should trigger a coordinating function:
# about_me() - returns a multi-line string with a short bio about yourself
# q_and_a() - reurns a random answer from a preset list of options you choose 
# guestbook() - ask the user for their firstname,lastname, and a message and it saves it to a dictionary
# random() - returns

# menu stays active until user inputs "goodbye"
